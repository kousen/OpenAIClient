这是一篇看完就想动起来的阅读 This is a reading that makes you want to move after reading it. 一,运动让你身体健康 One, exercise makes you healthy. 运动的好处人人都知道 Everyone knows the benefits of exercise. 但在运动前,我们往往还是会找出各种各样的借口 But before exercise, we often find all kinds of excuses. 下雨了,晚上聚餐,换运动服好麻烦,器材还没准备全 It's raining, having dinner at night, changing sportswear is a hassle, and the equipment is not ready yet. 但如果问那些常常运动的人,他们往往只有一句话,出发就对了 But if you ask those who often exercise, they often have only one sentence, just go. 运动不是保养身体最轻松的方式,但却是效果最好,最有益的一种 Exercise is not the easiest way to take care of your body, but it is the most effective and meaningful way. 运动能增强人的体魄,锻造人的意志力 Exercise can strengthen one's body, create one's willpower. 越是经常运动的人,身体越是健康,状态也越是年轻 The more you exercise, the healthier you are, and the younger you are. 别再因为忙碌而输于运动,别再因为懒惰而怠于运动 Don't lose to exercise because you are busy, don't be lazy to exercise. 只有拥有一个好的身体,才能去顾好自己想要的生活,当一个人爱上运动时,身体自然会给你最好的反馈 Only having a good body can make you live the life you want. When a person falls in love with exercise, the body will naturally give you the best feedback. 生活中,一个爱运动的人,通常都有乐观的心态,即便他们遇到挑战和难关,也会有信心和勇气去面对 In life, a person who loves to exercise usually has an optimistic attitude, even if they encounter challenges and difficulties, they will have confidence and courage to face them. 穿行于风中,奔跑在阳光中,那些困扰你的负面情绪也会随之消散,当你觉得跑五公里已经是极限,在坚持一段时间,发现可以再跑得更远一点时,你就会建立起可以面对一切挑战的自信 When you run in the wind, run in the sun, those negative emotions that bother you will disappear. When you feel that running five kilometers is the limit, hold on for a while, and find that you can run a little further, you will build up the confidence to face all challenges. 当你动起来,你就会发现很多事情其实并没有那么难 When you move, you will find that many things are not that difficult. 运动让你学会自律,真正的自律从来不是一蹴而就的,运动就是培养自律的方式之一,每天坚持锻炼并把这份坚持延续到生活中,你就能保持高度的专注力和自制力。 当别人还在打游戏时,你已经完成了健身,当别人还在对闹铃声满腹牢骚时,你已经完成了晨跑,当一个人能够保持自律,他的人生也会因此而拥有更多的选择权。 你流的每一滴汗都不会被辜负,你在运动上花费的每一秒都不会被浪费,运动与不运动过的是截然不同的人生。 看完这篇业读,明天就去运动起来吧。
