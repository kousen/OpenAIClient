For more information or to become a volunteer, visit the website LibriVox.org I heard the ceramellas in my sleep. I heard a sound of nannies. There are all the stars in the sky. There are the lights in the huts. The ceramellas came from the dark mountains without saying anything. All the good, poor people have risen in their huts. Everyone has risen from his bed. He turns on the light under the trough. They know those lights of shadow and noise. Of chaotic steps. Of serious voices. The light bulbs shine around, there in the house, here on the sieve. It seems to the earth, before the day, a small, large manger. In the blue sky, all the stars seem to remain as if waiting. And here the ceramellas raise their sweet sound of church. Sound of church, sound of cloister. Sound of house, sound of cradle. Sound of mother. Sound of our sweet past crying for nothing. O ceramellas of the first years. Before the day, before the truth. Now that the stars are there, sublime. Conceit of our brief mystery. That you do not yet think of bread. That you do not yet light the fire. Before the cry of the bells. So let us cry a little. Not more than anything, yes, of something, of many things. But the heart wants it. That big cry that then rests. That great pain that then does not hurt. Above the new pen and its veins, that single one wants without reason. On his martyrdom, on his pleasure, that ancient good tear flows. End of Giovanni Pascoli's Ceramellas
