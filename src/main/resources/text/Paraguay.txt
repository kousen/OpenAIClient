Good morning, here I share some curiosities about Paraguay. Did you know that this country is located in the heart of South America and that it has two official languages? Spanish and Guarani, an indigenous language of the country and the South American region. Also, Paraguay is the only country that has what we consider the solid soup. It is also considered the largest exporter of hydroelectric energy in the world. It has very diverse climates within a very diverse territory. In addition, this country also became independent in two days, a long time ago, in 1811. Its currency, which is Guarani, is the oldest in all of South America. And also, although you may not believe it, as Paraguay is located in the middle of South America, surrounded by several countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia and Uruguay, this country has no sea exit, therefore it does not have beaches. But Paraguayans go to the rivers to take a shower every time it is hot in the streams, in what we consider the swimming pools. That's all and thank you very much.
